#### AWS Glue?

AWS Glue is a **serverless data integration service** designed to help you **discover, prepare, move, and integrate data** from various sources for analytics and application development. It's primarily used for building **data warehouses**, **data lakes**, and **data pipelines**.

#### ‚úÖ In One Sentence:

> Glue is AWS‚Äôs serverless data engineering platform that handles ETL, metadata management, orchestration [Àå…îÀêk…™Ààstre…™ Én], and connectivity, making it ideal for building data lakes and pipelines

</div>

#### Key Features & Benefits

- **Serverless:** No servers to provision or manage. Glue **auto-scales** based on your workload, and you **pay only for consumption**.
- **ETL  Capabilities:** Offers robust ETL functionalities, supporting diverse **data sources** and **targets**. You can use **PySpark** or **Scala** for ETL scripts or the visual interface in **Glue Studio**.
- **Data Catalog:** A **persistent metadata repository** that's a core Glue component. It stores **metadata** for all your data assets, including **table definitions**, **schemas**, and **location information**, facilitating data discovery and sharing.
- **Crawlers:** Automatically connect to your data sources, **infer data schemas**, and populate the **Data Catalog**, greatly simplifying schema management.
- **Glue Studio:** A **graphical interface** for visually creating, running, and monitoring ETL jobs with minimal code.
- **AWS Service Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like **S3**, **Redshift**, **RDS**, **Lake Formation**, and **SageMaker** for end-to-end data solutions.

#### Core Components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **AWS Glue Data Catalog** | Stores all **metadata**, including **table definitions**, **schemas**, and data **locations**. |
| **AWS Glue Crawlers** | Automatically **scan data sources**, **infer schemas**, and **update the Data Catalog**. |
| **AWS Glue ETL Jobs** | Execute **PySpark** or **Scala** scripts to perform **data transformations** and processing. |
| **AWS Glue Studio** | A **visual interface** for building, running, and monitoring **ETL jobs**. |
| **AWS Glue DataBrew** | (Part of the Glue suite) A **visual data preparation tool** for cleaning and normalising data **without code**. |
| **AWS Glue Data Quality** | Helps **assess and improve** the **quality of your data**. |

## S3 - Querying with Athena

Serverless SQL querying on S3, SerDe, Partitioning

Federated Query

<div align="left">
  <img src="docs/image%205.png" alt="Athena" width="350">
</div>

| Topic | Key Point | Why It Matters for the Exam |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Querying Data** | SQL on S3 | Athena lets you run SQL directly on S3 data (no ETL needed) |
|  | Partitioning | Reduces data scanned and cost; common exam topic |
|  | Parquet / ORC | Columnar formats = faster queries, lower costs |
| **2. Federated Queries** | Query across RDS, DynamoDB, etc. | Athena can query non-S3 sources using connectors (via Lambda) |
|  | IAM Role for Connector | Secure access is key; know how roles work with connectors |
| **3. Performance & Cost** | Pay-per-Scan ($5/TB) | Exam may ask how to reduce cost ‚Äì partitioning + columnar files |
|  | Partition Projection | Avoids full metadata scans, boosts performance |
|  | Compression & Format | Use Parquet/ORC for columnar compression |
| **3. Workgroups** | Query isolation & cost control | Used to manage query cost, access, and results per team |
|  | Query metrics & audit logs | For governance and troubleshooting |

---


## üìä Amazon Redshift  

### ‚úÖ 1. Basic Concepts
- **Definition**: AWS-managed distributed columnar data warehouse (MPP architecture)
- **Use Case**: Ideal for large-scale OLAP queries, BI reporting, data analysis
- **Architecture**:
  - Leader Node: Accepts queries, generates execution plans
  - Compute Nodes: Execute queries in parallel and process data

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Key Optimization Mechanisms

#### üìå 1. Distribution Style
Controls how data is distributed across compute nodes:

| Type | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| KEY | Hash by a specific column | For frequently joined columns |
| EVEN | Even distribution | When no obvious key or to avoid skew |
| ALL | Full copy on each node | For small dimension tables (broadcast joins) |

---

#### üìå 2. Sort Key
Defines physical row ordering to improve scan speed:

- Single-column Sort Key: For time or filter fields
- Compound Sort Key: Multiple columns in order of filter priority
- INTERLEAVED Sort Key: For multiple filter paths (more overhead)

---

#### üìå 3. Compression Encoding
- Set manually or auto-chosen (ZSTD, LZO, etc.)
- Boosts query performance and reduces storage

---

#### üìå 4. Vacuum & Analyze
- `VACUUM`: Removes deleted row remnants and reorganizes storage
- `ANALYZE`: Updates table stats for query planner

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Data Loading

#### üì• COPY Command Example

```sql
COPY target_table
FROM 's3://bucket/path/file.csv'
CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=...;aws_secret_access_key=...'
DELIMITER ',' IGNOREHEADER 1;
```

- Formats supported: CSV, JSON, Parquet
- Sources: S3, EMR, DynamoDB, DataStreams

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Redshift Spectrum (External Querying)
- Use Glue Data Catalog to manage external tables in S3
- Enables direct querying of raw S3 data (no loading)
- Best for separating hot/cold data in data lake architecture

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Redshift vs Hive vs SparkSQL

| Feature | Redshift | Hive | SparkSQL |
|--------|----------|------|----------|
| Type | Managed MPP(Massively Parallel Processing) Data Warehouse | Hadoop SQL Engine | In-memory distributed SQL |
| Storage | Internal columnar store | HDFS | HDFS/S3/other external |
| Latency | Fast | Slow | Fast |
| Deployment | Fully managed | Self-hosted Hadoop | Self-host
